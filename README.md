Adopt, Don't Shop:
A Rails application to provide Shelters a place to show their pets available for adoption.

Technologies Used:
Rails
PostgreSQL
Deployment to Heroku


Learning Goals:
Adopt, Don't Shop introduced sessions for tracking a user's favorite pets. Also, additional functionality was built out for shelters, pets, and application functionality was implemented.

Main Features:
Shelters have full CRUD functionality for both themselves and their pets.
Pets link to their current shelter, and can be favorited for adoption applications.
Applications can be submitted for multiple pets with a single form.

Future Features:
Messaging between users and shelters
User portal for accessing resources such as vet records

Volunteer portal for searching for open positions
Foster Parent portal for shelter pets in satellite locations
